SSH Honeypot Monitoring & Attacker Behavior Analysis – Cowrie Project

This project demonstrates how to deploy, configure, and monitor an SSH honeypot using Cowrie on a Kali Linux virtual machine.
The honeypot captures attacker behavior in real time, including:

SSH login attempts

executed commands

system enumeration attempts

failed commands

session replay (TTY logs)

IP address, timestamp, session ID

potential malware download attempts

The project mimics the workflow of a SOC Analyst, focusing on threat detection, behavioral analysis, and log interpretation.
